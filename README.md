# Rails Lite

In this project, we implement some of the basic functionality from
Rails.

## Phase I: Rack

Let's start out by building what happens when you run `rails server`.

Run the file with `bundle exec ruby bin/p01_basic_server.rb` (ensures you run with local gems), then in your browser navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should
see `Hello world!`. Congratulations, you've written a Rack application.
